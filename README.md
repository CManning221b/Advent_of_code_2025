# First Year of Attempting 'Advent of Code' 

### Day one 02.12.2025 @ 02:00
Keen to see how quickly I can solve each one, attempting day one has immediately revealed my fondness for OOP, even on a simple problem I can't help but
see everything as an object with a set of properties. 

### Day two 02.12.2025 @ 15:00
Managed to complete both parts today, and made use of inheritance to clena up both today and yesterdays puzzles 

### Day three 03.12.2025 @ 17:00
The first part of this was astonishingly easy, the second part took up an embarressing amount of my day. Tried several different solutions that were partially correct before I stumbled upon the windowed search. Then spent ages with a solution that solved the test problem, but which failed the actual goal. Finally realised I had a tiny array splicing bug that would show up if there were duplicate values in the window. Fixed that and everything ran smooth. 

### Day four 05.12.2025 @ 12:00
Was late getting to this one, but maybe my favourite day so far. Matrices, kernels and filtering ! What a fun little challenge. 

### Day five 07.12.2025 @ 06:00
Busy couple of days and I've fallen behind once more. Fairly simple, tried brute forcing this at first to rush it, then had to find a way to merge the lists
